    To implement this protocol, you need to listen for Notification.Name.DisplayModeDidChange notifications. When the notification fires, call displayModeDidChange(newMode: animated:). Implement displayModeDidChange to update UI elements according to the display mode. This method will be called within an animation block whenever appropiate.
